    "The iterative quantum phase estimation (IQPE, also known as IPEA) algorithm is a quantum algorithm for estimating the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [[1], [2]]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies) of some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian. Because $H$ is a Hermitian operator, not unitary, (the algorithm works only with unitary operators) we can't estimate directly its eigenvalues. Instead, we create some unitary operator from $H$ and estimate not the eigenvalues of $H$, but something different (the phase). From the estimated phase one can obtain the corresponding eigenvalue of $H$. So, in the end, we are not only estimating the phase but, what is more important, the desired eigenvalue. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create unitary operator $U$ from given $H$: \n",
    "$$U = e^{iHt}.$$ \n",
    "Here $t$ is a parameter.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Apply $U$ on the eigenstate $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ of $H$. For simplicity, we will assume that the eigenstate is given: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Taylor series for the exponent we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = i t H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - \\frac{t^2}{2} H^2 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle + \\frac{t^4}{4} H^4 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And by using the Schr√∂dinger equation $H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = E_{k} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$, we will obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_k$ is the eigenvalue of the corresponding $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ eigenstate. The goal of the algorithm is to find $E_k$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt}\\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle  = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_k} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi_k = E_{k}t / 2 \\pi$ is the phase that the algorithm is capable to estimate. After estimating the phase it will be easy to estimate the corresponding eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{k} = 2 \\pi \\varphi_k / t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how the algorithm actually works. Firstly, we should import all the packages that we will use.\n",

Assume we have the Hamiltonian $H = h_1 + h_2 + h_3$ and in the algorithm the circuit for $U = e^{i H t}$ unitary operator should be constructed. For example, $h_i$s can be the Pauli matrices with real coefficients for single-qubit case: $H = a X + b Z $. In general case $U \\ne e^{i h_1 t} \\cdot e^{i h_2 t} \\cdot e^{i h_3 t}$ (there should be equality if all $h_i$s commute). To obtain more or less valid circuit for $U$ operator we can do (first order) Trotter decomposition [[2], [3]]:\n",

By increasing $N$ it is possible to decrease the error of the Trotter decomposition as much as desired [[3]]. Our example of the Hamiltonian was simple (2x2 diagonal matrix) and that is why the right result was obtained without doing this step. Also, our Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{E_1 + E_2}{2}I + \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{2} Z$ has commuting members in the presented sum ($I$ commutes with all operators), thus we can write:\n",

For this $H$ we have directly found the circuit that corresponds to the $e^{iHt}$, without even presenting it by the sum of Pauli matrices as an intermediate step. If we have more complex Hamiltonians, then the technique of creating the circuit that corresponds to $e^{iHt}$ can be found in the [Hamiltonian simulation][4] tutorial.\n",

    "One more thing. If $E_2 < 0$ then the final step of the algorithm should be changed a little bit. In that case, note that $e^{iE_2t} = e^{-i \\left|E_2 \\right| t } = e^{i \\left( 2 \\pi-\\left|E_2 \\right| t \\right) } = e^{i \\varphi_2^* }$. Because of this, the algorithm will estimate $\\varphi_2^* = 2 \\pi-\\left|E_2 \\right| t$ and in the final step instead of $E_2 = 2  \\pi  \\varphi_2^* / t$ we should write $E_2 = -2  \\pi  (1 - \\varphi_2^*) / t$.\n",
