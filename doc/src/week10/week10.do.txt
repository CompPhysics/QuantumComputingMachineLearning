===== Principle of Superposition and Fourier Transforms =====

For problems with so-called harmonic oscillations, given by for example the following differential equation
!bt
\[
m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\eta\frac{dx}{dt}+x(t)=F(t),
\]
!et
where $F(t)$ is an applied external force acting on the system (often
called a driving force), one can use the theory of Fourier
transformations to find the solutions of this type of equations.

!split
===== Several driving forces =====
If one has several driving forces, $F(t)=\sum_n F_n(t)$, one can find
the particular solution $x_{pn}(t)$ to the above differential equation for each $F_n$. The particular
solution for the entire driving force is then given by a series like

!bt
\[
x_p(t)=\sum_nx_{pn}(t).
\]
!et

This is known as the principle of superposition. It only applies when
the homogenous equation is linear. 
Superposition is especially useful when $F(t)$ can be written
as a sum of sinusoidal terms, because the solutions for each
sinusoidal (sine or cosine)  term is analytic. 

!split
===== Periodicity =====

Driving forces are often periodic, even when they are not
sinusoidal. Periodicity implies that for some time $t$ our function repeats itself periodically after a period $\tau$, that is

!bt
\[
F(t+\tau)=F(t). 
\]
!et

One example of a non-sinusoidal periodic force is a square wave. Many
components in electric circuits are non-linear, for example diodes. This 
makes many wave forms non-sinusoidal even when the circuits are being
driven by purely sinusoidal sources.

!split
===== Simple Code Example =====

The code here shows a typical example of such a square wave generated
using the functionality included in the _scipy_ Python package. We
have used a period of $\tau=0.2$.

# start and final times

tn = 1.0

t = np.linspace(t0, tn, n, endpoint=False)
SqrSignal = np.zeros(n)
SqrSignal = 1.0+signal.square(2*np.pi*5*t)
plt.plot(t, SqrSignal)
plt.ylim(-0.5, 2.5)
plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== Sinusoidal example =====
For the sinusoidal example the
period is $\tau=2\pi/\omega$. However, higher harmonics can also
satisfy the periodicity requirement. In general, any force that
satisfies the periodicity requirement can be expressed as a sum over
harmonics,

!bt
\[
F(t)=\frac{f_0}{2}+\sum_{n>0} f_n\cos(2n\pi t/\tau)+g_n\sin(2n\pi t/\tau).
\]
!et

!split
===== Wrapping up Fourier transforms =====

We can write down the answer for
$x_{pn}(t)$, by substituting $f_n/m$ or $g_n/m$ for $F_0/m$. By
writing each factor $2n\pi t/\tau$ as $n\omega t$, with $\omega\equiv
2\pi/\tau$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:fourierdef1}
F(t)=\frac{f_0}{2}+\sum_{n>0}f_n\cos(n\omega t)+g_n\sin(n\omega t).
\end{equation}
!et

The solutions for $x(t)$ then come from replacing $\omega$ with
$n\omega$ for each term in the particular solution,

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
x_p(t)&=&\frac{f_0}{2k}+\sum_{n>0} \alpha_n\cos(n\omega t-\delta_n)+\beta_n\sin(n\omega t-\delta_n),\\
\nonumber
\alpha_n&=&\frac{f_n/m}{\sqrt{((n\omega)^2-\omega_0^2)+4\beta^2n^2\omega^2}},\\
\nonumber
\beta_n&=&\frac{g_n/m}{\sqrt{((n\omega)^2-\omega_0^2)+4\beta^2n^2\omega^2}},\\
\nonumber
\delta_n&=&\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2\beta n\omega}{\omega_0^2-n^2\omega^2}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Finding the Coefficients =====

Because the forces have been applied for a long time, any non-zero
damping eliminates the homogenous parts of the solution. We need then 
only consider the particular solution for each $n$.

The problem is considered solved if one can find expressions for the
coefficients $f_n$ and $g_n$, even though the solutions are expressed
as an infinite sum. The coefficients can be extracted from the
function $F(t)$ by

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
label{eq:fourierdef2}
f_n&=&\frac{2}{\tau}\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2} dt~F(t)\cos(2n\pi t/\tau),\\
\nonumber
g_n&=&\frac{2}{\tau}\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2} dt~F(t)\sin(2n\pi t/\tau).
\end{eqnarray}
!et

To check the consistency of these expressions and to verify
Eq. (ref{eq:fourierdef2}), one can insert the expansion of $F(t)$ in
Eq. (ref{eq:fourierdef1}) into the expression for the coefficients in
Eq. (ref{eq:fourierdef2}) and see whether

!bt
\[
f_n=\frac{2}{\tau}\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2} dt~\left\{\frac{f_0}{2}+\sum_{m>0}f_m\cos(m\omega t)+g_m\sin(m\omega t)\right\}\cos(n\omega t).
\]
!et

Immediately, one can throw away all the terms with $g_m$ because they
convolute an even and an odd function. The term with $f_0/2$
disappears because $\cos(n\omega t)$ is equally positive and negative
over the interval and will integrate to zero. For all the terms
$f_m\cos(m\omega t)$ appearing in the sum, one can use angle addition
formulas to see that $\cos(m\omega t)\cos(n\omega
t)=(1/2)(\cos[(m+n)\omega t]+\cos[(m-n)\omega t]$. This will integrate
to zero unless $m=n$. In that case the $m=n$ term gives

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2}dt~\cos^2(m\omega t)=\frac{\tau}{2},
\end{equation}
!et

and

!bt
\[
f_n=\frac{2}{\tau}\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2} dt~f_n/2=f_n.
\]
!et

The same method can be used to check for the consistency of $g_n$.

===== Final words on Fourier Transforms =====

The code here uses the Fourier series applied to a 
square wave signal. The code here
visualizes the various approximations given by Fourier series compared
with a square wave with period $T=0.2$ (dimensionless time), width $0.1$ and max value of the force $F=2$. We
see that when we increase the number of components in the Fourier
series, the Fourier series approximation gets closer and closer to the
square wave signal.

=== Fourier transforms and convolution ===

We can use Fourier transforms in our studies of convolution as well. To see this, assume we have two functions $f$ and $g$ and their corresponding Fourier transforms $\hat{f}$ and $\hat{g}$. We remind the reader that the Fourier transform reads (say for the function $f$)

!bt
\[
\hat{f}(y)=\bm{F}[f(y)]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \exp{-i\omega y} f(\omega),
\]
!et
and similarly we have
!bt
\[
\hat{g}(y)=\bm{F}[g(y)]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \exp{-i\omega y} g(\omega).
\]
!et
The inverse Fourier transform is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{F}^{-1}[g(y)]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \exp{i\omega y} g(\omega).
\]
!et


The inverse Fourier transform of the product of the two functions $\hat{f}\hat{g}$ can be written as
!bt
\[
\bm{F}^{-1}[(\hat{f}\hat{g})(x)]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \exp{i\omega x} \hat{f}(\omega)\hat{g}(\omega).
\]
!et
We can rewrite the latter as
!bt
\[
\bm{F}^{-1}[(\hat{f}\hat{g})(x)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \exp{i\omega x} \hat{f}(\omega)\left[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(y)dy \exp{-i\omega y}\right]=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dy g(y)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega \hat{f}(\omega) \exp{i\omega(x- y)},
\]
!et
which is simply 
!bt
\[
\bm{F}^{-1}[(\hat{f}\hat{g})(x)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dy g(y)f(x-y)=(f*g)(x),
\]
!et
the convolution of the functions $f$ and $g$.




!split
===== Discrete Fourier Transformations =====

Consider two sets of complex numbers $x_k$ and $y_k$ with
$k=0,1,\dots,n-1$ entries. The discrete Fourier transform is defined
as
!bt
\[
y_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \exp{(\frac{2\pi\imath jk}{n})} x_j.
\]
!et
As an example, assume $x_0=1$ and $x_1=1$. We can then use the above expression to find $y_0$ and $y_1$.

With the above formula we get then
!bt
\[
y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \exp{(\frac{2\pi\imath 0\times 1}{2})} \times 1+\exp{(\frac{2\pi\imath 0\times 1}{2})}\times 2\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1+2)=\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
y_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \exp{(\frac{2\pi\imath 0\times 1}{2})} \times 1+\exp{(\frac{2\pi\imath 1\times 1}{2})}\times 2\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1+2\exp{(\pi\imath)})=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
!et


We can rewrite this in terms of the following matrix-vector operation. More material to come here.

===== Quantum Fourier Transform =====

We turn now our attention to the quantum mechanical analogue of the discrete Fourier transform.
Again, we will express the final mathemtical operations interms of specific linear and invertible operations.
Furthermore, the quantum version  of the 
discrete Fourier transform requires only $O(n\log{n})$ gates
to be implemented, and is a part of many important quantum algorithms
such as phase estimation.


A useful way to solve problems in many fields of science, especially
in physics and mathematics, is to transform it into some other (often
simpler) problem for which a solution is known. The discrete fourier
transform, which involves such a transformation, is one of a few known
algorithms that can be computed much faster on a quantum computer than
on a classical.

!split
===== Fourier transform =====

Assume a periodic function $f(x)$ in an interval
$[ -\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2} ]$. The fourier series in exponential form can be written
as
!bt
\[
f(x) = \sum_{-\inf}^\inf A_n e^{i(2\pi nx/L)}
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
A_n = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f(x)e^{-i(2\pi nx/L)} dx
\]
!et

In the fourier transform $A_n$ is transformed from a dicrete variable
to a continous one as $L \rightarrow \inf$. We then replace $A_n$ with
$f(k)dk$ and let $n/L \rightarrow k$, and the sum is changed to an
integral. This gives

 
!bt
\[
f(x) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf}dkF(k) e^{i(2\pi kx)}
\]
!et

!bt
\[
F(k) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf}dxf(x) e^{-i(2\pi kx)}
\]
!et 
One way to interpret the Fourier transform is then as a transformation from one basis to another. 

!split
===== Discrete Fourier transform =====

Next we make another generalization by having a discrete function,
that is $f(x) \rightarrow f(x_k)$ with $x_k = k\Delta x$ for $k=0,\dots, N-1$. This leads to the sums


!bt
\[
f_x = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}F_k e^{i(2\pi kx)/N},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
F_k = \sum_{x=0}^{N-1}f_x e^{-i(2\pi kx)/N}.
\]
!et

Although we have used functions here, this could also be a set of
numbers. As an example we can have a set of complex numbers $\{x_0,\dots,x_{N-1}\}$ with fixed length $N$, we can Fourier transform
this as


!bt
\[
y_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j e^{i(2\pi jk)/N}
\]
!et

leading to a new set of complex numbers $\{ y_0,\dots,y_{N-1}\}$. 

!split
===== Quantum Fourier transform =====

We now turn to the quantum Fourier transform. It is the same
transformation as described above, however we define it in terms of
the unitary operation

!bt
\[
    \ket{\psi'} \leftarrow \hat{F}\ket{\psi}, \quad \hat{F}^\dagger \hat{F} = I
\]
!et

In terms of an orthonormal basis $\ket{0},\ket{1},\dots,\ket{0}$ this linear operator has the following action

!bt
\[
\ket{j} \rightarrow \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{i(2\pi jk/N)}\ket{k}
\]
!et

 or on an arbitrary state

!bt
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j \ket{j} \rightarrow \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} y_k\ket{k}
\]
!et

equivalent to the equation for discrete Fourier transform on a set of complex numbers.
 
Next we assume an $n$-qubit system, where we take $N=s^n$ in the computational basis 
!bt
\[
\ket{0},\dots,\ket{2^n -1}
\]
!et

We make use of the binary representation $j = j_1 2^{n-1} + j_2
2^{n-2} + \dots + j_n 2^0$ , and take note of the notation $0.j_l
j_{l+1} \dots j_m$ representing the binary fraction $\frac{j_l}{2^1} +
\frac{j_{l+1}}{2^{2}} + \dots + \frac{j_m}{2^{m-l+1}}$. With this we
define the product representation of the quantum Fourier transform

!bt
\[
\ket{j_1,\dots,j_n} \rightarrow 
\frac{
\left(\ket{0} + e^{i(2\pi 0.j_n)}\right)
\left(\ket{0} + e^{i(2\pi 0.j_{j-1}j_n)}\right)
\dots
\left(\ket{0} + e^{i(2\pi 0.j_1j_2\dots j_n)}\right)
}{2^{n/2}}
\]
!et

!split
===== Components =====

From the product representation we can derive a circuit for the
quantum Fourier transform. This will make use of the following two
single-qubit gates
!bt
\[
    H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
!bt
\[
    R_k =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & e^{2\pi i/2^{k}}
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et

First we refresh our memory of the action of these gates. The hadamard
gate on a single qubit creates an equal superposition of its basis
states, assuming it is not already in a superposition, such that
 
!bt
\[
H\ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\right), \quad H\ket{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{0} - \ket{1}\right)
\]
!et 
The $R_k$ gate simply adds a phase if the qubit it acts on is in the state $\ket{1}$


!bt
\[
    R_k\ket{0} = \ket{0}, \quad R_k\ket{1} = e^{2\pi i/2^{k}}\ket{1}
\]
!et

Since all this gates are unitary, the quantum Fourier transfrom is also unitary.

!split
===== Algorithm =====

Assume we have a quantum register of $n$ qubits in the state $\ket{j_1
j_2 \dots j_n}$. Applying the hadamard gate to the first qubit
produces the state


!bt
\[
H\ket{j_1 j_2 \dots j_n} = \frac{\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_1}\ket{1}\right)}{2^{1/2}} \ket{j_2 \dots j_n}
\]
!et

where we have made use of the binary fraction to represent the action of the hadamard gate 

!bt
\[
\begin{equation}
e^{2\pi i 0.j_1} = 
\begin{cases}
-1, & \quad \text{if $j_1 = 1$} \\
+1, & \quad \text{if $j_1 = 0$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\]
!et

Furthermore we can apply the controlled-$R_k$ gate, with all the other qubits $j_k$ for $k>1$ as control qubits to produce the state

!bt
\[
\frac{\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_1j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right)}{2^{1/2}} \ket{j_2 \dots j_n}
\]
!et

Next we do the same procedure on qubit $2$ producing the state

!bt
\[
\frac{\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_1j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right)\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right)}{2^{2/2}} \ket{j_2 \dots j_n}
\]
!et

Doing this for all $n$ qubits yields state

!bt
\[
\frac{\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_1j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right)\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right)\dots \left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_n}\ket{1}\right)}{2^{n/2}} \ket{j_2 \dots j_n}
\]
!et
At the end we use swap gates to reverse the order of the qubits

!bt
\[
\frac{\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_n}\ket{1}\right)\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_{n-1}j_n}\ket{1}\right)\dots\left(\ket{0} + e^{2\pi i 0.j_1j_2\dots j_n}\ket{1}\right) }{2^{n/2}} \ket{j_2 \dots j_n}
\]
!et
This is just the product representation from earlier, obviously our desired output.
