===== Introduction  ===== 


In order to study entanglement and why it is so important for quantum
computing, we need to introduce some basic measures and useful
quantities.  These quantities are the spectral decomposition of
hermitian operators, how these are then used to define measurements
and how we can define so-called density operators (matrices). These
are all quantities which will become very useful when we discuss
entanglement and in particular how to quantify it. In order to define
these quantities we need to remind ourselves about some basic linear
algebra properties of hermitian operators and matrices.
