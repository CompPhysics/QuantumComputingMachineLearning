===== Introduction  ===== 


In order to study entanglement and why it is so important for quantum
computing, we need to introduce some basic measures and useful
quantities.  For these endeavors, we  will use our two-qubit system from
the previous lecture in order to introduce, through examples, density
matrices and entropy.
