===== Introduction  ===== 


In order to study entanglement and why it is so important for quantum
computing, we need to introduce some basic measures and useful
quantities.  These quantities are the spectral decomposition of
hermitian operators, how these are then used to define measurements
and how we can define so-called density operators (matrices). These
are all quantities which will become very useful when we discuss
entanglement and in particular how to quantify it. In order to define
these quantities we need first to remind ourselves about some basic linear
algebra properties of hermitian operators and matrices.


===== Basic properties of hermitian operators =====

The operators we typically encounter in quantum mechanical studies
o Hermitian (self-adjoint) meaning that for example the elements of a Hermitian matrix $\bm{U}$ obey $u_{ij}=u_{ji}^*$.
o Unitary $\bm{U}\bm{U}^{\dagger}=\bm{U}^{\dagger}\bm{U}=\bm{I}$, where $\bm{I}$ is the unit matrix
o The oparator $\bm{U}$ and its self-adjoint commute (often labeled as normal operators), that is  ${\bm{U},\bm{U}^{\dagger}]=0$

Unitary operators in a Hilbert space preserve the norm and orthogonality. If $\bm{U}$ is a unitary operator acting on a state $\vert \psi_j\rangle$, the action of

!bt
\[
\vert \phi_i\rangle=\bm{U}\vert \psi_j\rangle,
\]
!et
preserves both the norm and orthogonality, that is $\langle \phi_i \vert \phi_j\rangle=\langle \psi_i \vert \psi_j\rangle=\delta_{ij}$, as discussed earlier.

As example, consider the Pauli matrix $\sigma_x$. We have already seen that this matrix is a unitary matrix. Consider then an orthogonal and normalized basis $\vert 0\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vert 1\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1\end{bmatrix}$ and a state which is a linear superposition of these two basis states

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 0\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et

A new state $\vert \psi_b\rangle$ is given by
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_b\rangle=\sigma_x\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 1\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 0\rangle.
\]
!et

=== Spectral Decomposition ===

An important techanicality which we will use in the discussion of
density matrices, entanglement, quantum entropies and other properties
is the so-called spectral decomposition of an operator.

Let $\vert \psi\rangle be a vector in a Hilbert space of dimension $n$ and a hermitian operator $\bm{A}$ defined in this
space. Assume $\vert \psi\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, that is

!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert psi\rangle = \lambda\vert \psi\rangle = \lambda \bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle,
\]
!et
where we used $\bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle = 1 \vert \psi \rangle$.
Subtracting the right hand side from the left hand side gives
!bt
\[
\left[\bm{A}-\lambda \bm{I}\right]\vert \psi \rangle=0
\]
!et
