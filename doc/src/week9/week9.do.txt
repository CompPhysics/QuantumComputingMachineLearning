Reading recommendation: Hundt's chapter 3 and 4 contain many useful hints for computing properties of Pauli matrices.
For the Lipkin model, we recommend strongly the work of LaRose and collaborators, see

!split
===== Hamiltonians and project 1 =====

As an initial test, we consider a simply $2\times 2$ real
Hamiltonian consistend of a diagonal part $H_0$ and off-diagonal part
$H_I$, playing the roles of a non-interactive one-body and interactive
two-body part respectively. Defined through their matrix elements, we
express them in the Pauli basis $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1 \rangle$

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split} 
        H &= H_0 + H_I \\
        H_0 = \begin{bmatrix}
            E_1 & 0 \\
            0 & E_2
        \end{bmatrix}&, \hspace{20px}
        H_I = \lambda \begin{bmatrix}
            V_{11} & V_{12} \\
            V_{21} & V_{22}
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et
Where $\lambda \in [0,1]$ is a coupling constant parameterizing the strength of the interaction. 

!split
===== Rewriting in terms of Pauli matrices =====

Defining
!bt
\[
    E_+ = \frac{E_1 + E_2}{2},\hspace{20px} E_- = \frac{E_1 - E_2}{2}
\]
!et
we see that by combining the identity and $Z$ Pauli matrix, this can be expressed as

!bt
\[
    H_0 = E_+ I + E_- Z
\]
!et

For $H_1$ we use the same trick to fill the diagonal, defining $V_+ = (V_{11} + V_{22})/2, V_- = (V_{11} - V_{22})/2$. From the hermiticity requirements of $H$, we note that $V_{12} = V_{21} \equiv V_o$, which simplifies the problem to a simple $X$. This gives

!bt
\[
    H_I = V_+ I + V_- Z + V_o X
\]
!et

!split
===== Measurement basis =====

For this system we note that the Pauli $X$ matrix can be rewritten in terms of the Hadamard matrices and the Pauli $Z$ matrix, that is
!bt
\[
X=HZH.
\]
!et


!split
===== Second Hamiltonian matrix problems =====

The second case is defined as a $4 \times 4$ real Hamiltonian.
This can be viewed as two  composite systems where each system is a two-level system. In the product basis $\vert 00\rangle$, $\vert 01\rangle$, $\vert 10\rangle$ and $\vert 11\rangle$
we define the one-body part as 
!bt
\[
    H_0 \vert ij \rangle = \epsilon_{ij}\vert ij\rangle, 
\]
!et
with a two-body interaction defined as

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split} 
        H_I &= H_x X \otimes X + H_z Z \otimes Z \\
        &= \begin{bmatrix}
            H_z & 0 & 0 & H_z \\
            0 & - H_z & H_x & 0 \\
            0 & H_x & - H_z & 0 \\
            H_x & 0 & 0 & H_z
        \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et

Here $H_x$ and $H_z$ are coupling constants.

!split
===== Rewriting =====

For the $4 \times 4$ case, the interacting part of the
Hamiltonian is already
written in terms of Pauli matrices. On the other hand, we need to be rewrite the diagonal term.
We define
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon_{\pm 0} = \frac{\epsilon_{00}\pm\epsilon_{01}}{2},\hspace{20px}\epsilon_{\pm 1} = \frac{\epsilon_{10}\pm\epsilon_{11}}{2}.
\end{align*}
!et
We note that the energies $\epsilon_{00}$ and $\epsilon_{01}$ can be repeated on the diagonal. This is also the case for $\epsilon_{10}$ and $\epsilon_{11}$
!bt
\begin{align*}
    D_{0} &= \epsilon_{+0} I\otimes I + \epsilon_{-0} I\otimes Z, \\
    D_{1} &= \epsilon_{+0} I\otimes I + \epsilon_{-1} I\otimes Z.
\end{align*}
!et
!split
===== Further manipulations =====

Using the Pauli $Z$ matrix and the identity matrix $I$ we define
!bt
\begin{align*}
    P_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(I \pm Z),
\end{align*}
!et
which we use to project out the first and last to two elements the of $4\times 4$ matrix
!bt
\[
    P_0 = P_+ \otimes I,\hspace{20px}P_0 = P_- \otimes I.
\]
!et
Adding $D_0$ and $D_1$, we get
!bt
\[
    H_0 = P_0 D_0 + P_1 D_1= \alpha_+ I \otimes I + \alpha_- Z \otimes I + \beta_+ I \otimes Z + \beta_- Z \otimes Z, 
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
    \alpha_\pm = \frac{\epsilon_{+0}\pm\epsilon_{+1}}{2}, \hspace{10px} \beta_\pm = \frac{\epsilon_{-0}\pm\epsilon_{+1}}{2}
\]
!et

!split
===== The Lipkin model =====

Last week we introduced the Lipkin model which could be rewritten in terms of the quasipin operators as
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        H_0 &= \epsilon J_z, \\
        H_1 &= \frac{1}{2}V (J_+^2 + J_-^2), \\
        H_2 & = \frac{1}{2}W ( J_+J_- +J_{-}J_+ - N ),
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Quasispin operators =====

These quasi spin operators obey the normal spin commutator relations
!bt
\begin{align*}
    &[J_z,J_{\pm}] = \pm J_\pm, 
    &[J_+,J_-] = 2 J_z, \\
    &[J^2,J_{\pm}] = 0,
    &[J^2,J_z] = 0,
\end{align*}
!et
in addition to commuting with the number operator
!bt
\begin{align*}
    [N,J_z] = [N,J_{\pm}] = [N,J^2] = 0.
\end{align*}
!et
Using these relations we can show that the Hamiltonian (a product of
quasi spin operators and the number operator) also commutes with
$J^2$, that is $[H,J^2]=0$. This means that $H$ and $J^2$ have a shared
eigenbasis, with $J$ being a so-called _good_ quantum number.

!split
===== System to diagonalize by traditional methods =====

Using spin-eigenstates as the Hamiltonian basis, we define states
through the normal approach $\vert J,J_z\rangle$ with $J$ and $ J_z$ as spin
and spin-projections, respectively. The states $J_z = \pm J$ are the
easiest to construct, corresponding to a single level being completely
filled. States in between can then be found using the quasi-spin
ladder operators following

!bt
\[
    J_\pm \vert J,J_z\rangle = \sqrt{J(J+1)-J_z (J_z \pm 1)} \vert J,J_z \pm 1\rangle.
\]
!et

Using this basis for the quasi-spin Hamiltonian, we can rewrite the explicit matrix $H_{J_z,J'_z} = \langle J,J_z\vert  H \vert J,J_z'\rangle$ can be constructed.

!split
===== The $J=1$ case =====

For $N=2$ particles, we have the triplet $J=1$, with three possible projection $J_z = 0, \pm 1$. This gives the following matrix
!bt
\[
    H = \begin{bmatrix} \label[eq]{eq:theo:lipkin_N2_matrix}
        -\epsilon & 0 & V \\
        0 & W & 0 \\
        V & 0 & \epsilon
    \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
By solving the eigenvalue problem, the ground state energy can be exactly found.


!split
===== The $J=2$ case =====

Similarly, for the $N=4$ particles case we have $J = 2$ with five possible projections $J_z = 0,\pm1,\pm2$. This gives us the Hamiltonian matrix
!bt
\[
    H = \begin{bmatrix}\label[eq]{eq:theo:lipkin_N4_matrix}
        -2\epsilon & 0  & \sqrt{6}V &0 &0 \\
        0 & -\epsilon + 3W & 0 & 3V & 0 \\
        \sqrt{6}V & 0 & 4W & 0 & \sqrt{6}V \\
        0 & 3V & 0 & \epsilon + 3W & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & \sqrt{6}V & 0 & 2\epsilon
    \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== More rewriting =====

Following the work of LaRose and collaborators, see
URL:"https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.106.024319",
we can rewrite the Lipkin Hamiltonian for efficient adaptations to
quantum computing.

We have
!bt
\[
    J_z = \sum_{i}^{N} j_{z}^{i} \hspace{20px} J_\pm = \sum_i^N j_{\pm}^{i} = \sum_i^N (j_{x}^{i}\pm ij_{y}^{i}),
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of particles. Additionally, since we have spin-$1/2$ fermions, the mapping to Pauli matrices follow
!bt
\[
    j_{x}^{i} = \frac{1}{2}X_i,\hspace{20px}j_{y}^{i} = \frac{1}{2}Y_i,\hspace{20px}j_{z}^{i} = \frac{1}{2}Z_i.
\]
!et
This means that we require $N$ qubits to calculate properties of a $N$ particle system, if no more symmetry reductions are considred.

!split
===== Lipkin Hamiltonian for quantum computing =====

We rewrote our Hamiltonian as
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}\label[eq]{eq:met:lipkin_pauli_hamiltonian} 
        H_0 &= \frac{\epsilon}{2}\sum_{p}Z_p,  \\
        H_1 &= \frac{1}{2}V \sum_{p < q} X_p X_q - Y_p Y_q, \\
        H_2 &= \frac{1}{2}W \sum_{p < q} \left( X_p X_q + Y_p Y_q \right). 
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et

For two particles coupling to spin $J=1$ we have
!bt
\[
    H^{N=2} = \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(Z_1 + Z_2\right) + \frac{W+V}{2} X_1 X_2 - \frac{W-V}{2} Y_1 Y_2.
\]
!et

!split
===== For four fermions =====
Our Hamiltonian for $N=4$ is
!bt
\begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
        H^{N=4} =& \frac{\epsilon}{2}\left(Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + Z_4\right) + \frac{W-V}{2}\Big( X_1 X_2 +\\ 
        & X_1 X_3 + X_1 X_4 + X_2 X_3 + X_3 X_4 + X_3 X_4
        \Big) \\
        &+ \frac{W+V}{2}\Big( Y_1 Y_2 + Y_1 Y_3 + Y_1 Y_4 + Y_2 Y_3 \\
        & + Y_3 Y_4 + Y_3 Y_4\Big).
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Leaving out the $W$ term =====

If we set $W = 0$ we can simplify the Hamiltonian. For this we  note that if we only include the $H_0$ and $H_1$ terms,  spins differing by $\pm2$ are the only possible non-diagonal couplings. Since $H_0$ is diagonal and single particle energies are degenerate, it does not break any symmetry.
Instead of the $2J+1$ spin projections, we simply have $J+1$ relevant states. From URL:"https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.106.024319",
the two-qubit Hamiltonian for $N=4$ can be written as
!bt
\[
    H_{W=0}^{N=4} = \epsilon(Z_1 + Z_2) + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}V (X_1 + X_2 + Z_1 X_0 - X_1 Z_0).
\]
!et
This is be more computationally efficient due to requiring only half the qubits.
