===== VQE overview =====

===== VQE and efficient computations of gradients  =====

We start with a reminder on the VQE method with applications to the
one-qubit system.  We discussed this to some detail during the week of
March 27-31. Here we revisit the one-qubit system and develop a VQE
code for studying this system using gradient descent as a method to
optimize the variational ansatz. 


We start with a simple $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix expressed in
terms of Pauli $X$ and $Z$ matrices, as discussed in the project text.

We define a  symmetric matrix  $H\in {\mathbb{R}}^{2\times 2}$
!bt
\[
H = \begin{bmatrix} H_{11} & H_{12} \\ H_{21} & H_{22}
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
We  let $H = H_0 + H_I$, where
!bt
\[
H_0= \begin{bmatrix} E_1 & 0 \\ 0 & E_2\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
is a diagonal matrix. Similarly,
!bt
\[
H_I= \begin{bmatrix} V_{11} & V_{12} \\ V_{21} & V_{22}\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where $V_{ij}$ represent various interaction matrix elements.
We can view $H_0$ as the non-interacting solution
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 0 \rangle =E_1\vert 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 1\rangle =E_2\vert 1\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
where we have defined the orthogonal computational one-qubit basis states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.


We rewrite $H$ (and $H_0$ and $H_I$)  via Pauli matrices
!bt
\[
H_0 = \mathcal{E} I + \Omega \sigma_z, \quad \mathcal{E} = \frac{E_1
  + E_2}{2}, \; \Omega = \frac{E_1-E_2}{2},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_I = c \bm{I} +\omega_z\sigma_z + \omega_x\sigma_x,
\]
!et
with $c = (V_{11}+V_{22})/2$, $\omega_z = (V_{11}-V_{22})/2$ and $\omega_x = V_{12}=V_{21}$.
We let our Hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $\lambda$

!bt
\[
H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
\]
!et

with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
system, respectively.  The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
two available states.

Here we set the parameters $E_1=0$,
$E_2=4$, $V_{11}=-V_{22}=3$ and $V_{12}=V_{21}=0.2$.

The non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
$\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
value of the parameter $V_{12}$ represents the strength of the coupling
between the two states.


=====  Setting up the matrix =====

!bc pycod
from  matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
dim = 2
Hamiltonian = np.zeros((dim,dim))
e0 = 0.0
e1 = 4.0
Xnondiag = 0.20
Xdiag = 3.0
Eigenvalue = np.zeros(dim)
# setting up the Hamiltonian
Hamiltonian[0,0] = Xdiag+e0
Hamiltonian[0,1] = Xnondiag
Hamiltonian[1,0] = Hamiltonian[0,1]
Hamiltonian[1,1] = e1-Xdiag
# diagonalize and obtain eigenvalues, not necessarily sorted
EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(Hamiltonian)
permute = EigValues.argsort()
EigValues = EigValues[permute]
# print only the lowest eigenvalue
print(EigValues[0])
!ec

Now rewrite it in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrix X and Z

!bc pycod
# Now rewrite it in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrix X and Z
X = np.array([[0,1],[1,0]])
Y = np.array([[0,-1j],[1j,0]])
Z = np.array([[1,0],[0,-1]])
# identity matrix
I = np.array([[1,0],[0,1]])

epsilon = (e0+e1)*0.5; omega = (e0-e1)*0.5
c = 0.0; omega_z=Xdiag; omega_x = Xnondiag
Hamiltonian = (epsilon+c)*I+(omega_z+omega)*Z+omega_x*X
EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(Hamiltonian)
permute = EigValues.argsort()
EigValues = EigValues[permute]
# print only the lowest eigenvalue
print(EigValues[0])
!ec




===== Implementing the VQE =====

For a one-qubit system we can reach every point on the Bloch sphere
(as discussed earlier) with a rotation about the $x$-axis and the
$y$-axis.

We can express this mathematically through the following operations (see whiteboard for the drawing), giving us a new state $\vert \psi\rangle$
!bt
\[
\vert\psi\rangle = R_y(\phi)R_x(\theta)\vert 0 \rangle.
\]
!et

We can produce multiple ansatzes for the new state in terms of the
angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.  With these ansatzes we can in turn
calculate the expectation value of the above Hamiltonian, now
rewritten in terms of various Pauli matrices (and thereby gates), that is compute

!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert (c+\mathcal{E})\bm{I} + (\Omega+\omega_z)\bm{\sigma}_z + \omega_x\bm{\sigma}_x\vert \psi \rangle.
\]
!et

We can now set up a series of ansatzes for $\vert \psi \rangle$ as
function of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and find thereafter the
variational minimum using for example a gradient descent method.

To do so, we need to remind ourselves about the mathematical expressions for
the rotational matrices/operators.

!bt
\[
R_x(\theta)=\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\bm{I}-\imath \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\bm{\sigma}_x,
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
R_y(\phi)=\cos{\frac{\phi}{2}}\bm{I}-\imath \sin{\frac{\phi}{2}}\bm{\sigma}_y.
\]
!et


!bc pycod
# define the rotation matrices
# Define angles theta and phi
theta = 0.5*np.pi; phi = 0.2*np.pi
Rx = np.cos(theta*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(theta*0.5)*X
Ry = np.cos(phi*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(phi*0.5)*Y
#define basis states
basis0 = np.array([1,0])
basis1 = np.array([0,1])

NewBasis = Ry @ Rx @ basis0
print(NewBasis)
# Compute the expectation value
#Note hermitian conjugation
Energy = NewBasis.conj().T @ Hamiltonian @ NewBasis
print(Energy)
!ec
Not an impressive results. We set up now a loop over many angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and compute the energies
!bc pycod
# define a number of angles
n = 20
angle = np.arange(0,180,10)
n = np.size(angle)
ExpectationValues = np.zeros((n,n))
for i in range (n):
    theta = np.pi*angle[i]/180.0
    Rx = np.cos(theta*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(theta*0.5)*X
    for j in range (n):
        phi = np.pi*angle[j]/180.0
        Ry = np.cos(phi*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(phi*0.5)*Y
        NewBasis = Ry @ Rx @ basis0
        Energy = NewBasis.conj().T @ Hamiltonian @ NewBasis
        Edifference=abs(np.real(EigValues[0]-Energy))
        ExpectationValues[i,j]=Edifference

print(np.min(ExpectationValues))
!ec

Clearly, this is not the best way of proceeding. Rather, here we
could try to find the optimal values for the parameters $\theta$ and
$\phi$ through computation of their respective gradients and thereby
find the minimum as function of the optimal angles $\hat{\theta}$ and
$\hat{\phi}$.

Let us now implement a classical gradient descent algorithm to the computation of the energies. 
We will follow closely  URL:"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331" in order to calculate gradients of the Hamiltonian.



===== Gradient descent and calculations of gradients =====

In order to optimize the VQE ansatz, we need to compute derivatives
with respect to the variational parameters.  Here we develop first a
simpler approach tailored to the one-qubit case. For this particular
case, we have defined an ansatz in terms of the Pauli rotation
matrices. These define an arbitrary one-qubit state on the Bloch
sphere through the expression

!bt
\[
\vert\psi\rangle = \vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle =R_y(\phi)R_x(\theta)\vert 0 \rangle.
\]
!et
Each of these rotation matrices can be written in a more general form as
!bt
\[
R_{i}(\gamma)=\exp{-(\imath\frac{\gamma}{2}\sigma_i)}=\cos{(\frac{\gamma}{2})}\bm{I}-\imath\sin{(\frac{\gamma}{2})}\bm{\sigma}_i,
\]
!et
where $\sigma_i$ is one of the Pauli matrices $\sigma_{x,y,z}$. 

It is easy to see that the derivative with respect to $\gamma$ is
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial R_{i}(\gamma)}{\partial \gamma}=-\frac{\gamma}{2}\bm{\sigma}_i R_{i}(\gamma).
\]
!et

We can now calculate the derivative of the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian in terms of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. We have two
derivatives 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left[\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_x\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle+\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{h.c},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi}\left[\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_y\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle+\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{h.c}. 
\]
!et

This means that we have to calculate two additional expectation values
in addition to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian itself.  If we
stay with an ansatz for the single qubit states given by the above
rotation operators, we can, following for example "the article by
Maria Schuld et
al":"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331",
show that the derivative of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
can be written as (we focus only on a given angle $\phi$)

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\phi)\rangle\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\phi+\frac{\pi}{2})\rangle-\langle\bm{H}(\phi-\frac{\pi}{2})\rangle\right].
\]
!et

To see this, consider again the definition of the rotation operators.
We can write these operators as

!bt
\[
R_i(\phi)=\exp{-\imath(\phi \bm{\sigma}_i)},
\]
!et
with $\bm{sigma}_i$, with $\bm{\sigma}_i$ being any of the Pauli
matrices $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. The latter can be generalized to other
unitary matrices as well.
The derivative with respect to $\phi$ gives
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial R_i(\phi)}{\partial \phi}=-\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i\exp{-\imath(\phi \bm{\sigma}_i)}=-\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma} R_i(\phi).
\]
!et
Our ansatz for a general one-qubit state on the Bloch sphere contains the product of a rotation around the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. In the derivation here we focus only on one angle however. Our ansatz is then given by

!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = R_i(\phi)\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et
and the expectation value of our Hamiltonian is

!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert \hat{H}\vert \psi \rangle = \langle 0 \vert R_i(\phi)^{\dagger} \hat{H}R_i(\phi)\vert 0\rangle. 
\]
!et
Our derivative with respect to the angle $\phi$ has a similar structure, that is
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi}\left[\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_y\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle+\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{h.c}. 
\]
!et


In order to rewrite the equation of the derivative,
the following relation is useful
!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert \hat{A}^{\dagger}\hat{B}\hat{C}\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left[
\langle \psi \vert (\hat{A}+\hat{C})^{\dagger}\hat{B}(\bm{A}+\hat{C})\vert \psi \rangle-\langle \psi \vert (\hat{A}-\hat{C})^{\dagger}\hat{B}(\bm{A}-\hat{C})\vert \psi \rangle\right],
\]
!et

where $\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$ and $\hat{C}$ are arbitrary hermitian
operators.  If we identify these operators as $\hat{A}=\bm{I}$, with
$\bm{I}$ being the unit operator, $\hat{B}=\hat{H}$ our Hamiltonian,
and $\hat{C}=-\imath \bm{\sigma}_i/2$, we obtain the following
expression for the expectation value of the derivative (excluding the hermitian conjugate)

!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert \bm{I}^{\dagger}\hat{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_i\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left[
\langle \psi \vert (\bm{I}-\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i)^{\dagger}\hat{H}(\bm{I}-\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i)\vert \psi \rangle-\langle \psi \vert (\bm{I}+\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i)^{\dagger}\hat{H}(\bm{I}+\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i)\vert \psi \rangle\right].
\]
!et

If we then use that the rotation matrices can be rewritten as
!bt
\[
R_{i}(\phi)=\exp{-(\imath\frac{\phi}{2}\sigma_i)}=\cos{(\frac{\phi}{2})}\bm{I}-\imath\sin{(\frac{\phi}{2})}\bm{\sigma}_i,
\]
!et
we see that if we set the angle to $\phi=\pi/2$, we have 
!bt
\[
R_{i}(\frac{\pi}{2})=\cos{(\frac{\pi}{4})}\bm{I}-\imath\sin{(\frac{\pi}{4})}\bm{\sigma}_i=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\bm{I}-\frac{\imath}{2} \bm{\sigma}_i\right).
\]
!et
This means that we can write
!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert \bm{I}^{\dagger}\hat{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_i\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left[
\langle \psi \vert R_i(\frac{\pi}{2})^{\dagger}\hat{H}R_i(\frac{\pi}{2})\vert \psi \rangle-\langle \psi \vert R_i(-\frac{\pi}{2})^{\dagger}\hat{H}R_i(-\frac{\pi}{2})^{\dagger}\vert \psi \rangle\right]=\frac{1}{2}(\langle\hat{H}(\phi+\frac{\pi}{2})\rangle-\langle\hat{H}(\phi-\frac{\pi}{2})\rangle).
\]
!et


===== Basics of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent =====

In order to implement the above equations, we need to remind the
reader about basic elements of various optimization approaches. Our
main focus here will be various gradient descent approaches, with and
without momentum and various approaches for approximating the second
derivatives via adaptive methods.

The material here is covered by the lectures from "FYS-STK4155 on gradient optimization":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/blob/master/doc/pub/week39/ipynb/week39.ipynb".

We will repeat some of the basic ingredients from these lectures.



===== Brief reminder on Newton-Raphson's method =====

Let us quickly remind ourselves how we derive the above method.

Perhaps the most celebrated of all one-dimensional root-finding
routines is Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson
method. This method  requires the evaluation of both the
function $f$ and its derivative $f'$ at arbitrary points. 
If you can only calculate the derivative
numerically and/or your function is not of the smooth type, we
normally discourage the use of this method.


===== The equations =====

The Newton-Raphson formula consists geometrically of extending the
tangent line at a current point until it crosses zero, then setting
the next guess to the abscissa of that zero-crossing.  The mathematics
behind this method is rather simple. Employing a Taylor expansion for
$x$ sufficiently close to the solution $s$, we have


!bt
\[
    f(s)=0=f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)+\frac{(s-x)^2}{2}f''(x) +\dots.
    \label{eq:taylornr}
\]
!et

For small enough values of the function and for well-behaved
functions, the terms beyond linear are unimportant, hence we obtain


!bt
\[
   f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)\approx 0,
\]
!et
yielding
!bt
\[
   s\approx x-\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}.
\]
!et

Having in mind an iterative procedure, it is natural to start iterating with
!bt
\[
   x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]
!et


===== Simple geometric interpretation =====

The above is Newton-Raphson's method. It has a simple geometric
interpretation, namely $x_{n+1}$ is the point where the tangent from
$(x_n,f(x_n))$ crosses the $x$-axis.  Close to the solution,
Newton-Raphson converges fast to the desired result. However, if we
are far from a root, where the higher-order terms in the series are
important, the Newton-Raphson formula can give grossly inaccurate
results. For instance, the initial guess for the root might be so far
from the true root as to let the search interval include a local
maximum or minimum of the function.  If an iteration places a trial
guess near such a local extremum, so that the first derivative nearly
vanishes, then Newton-Raphson may fail totally



===== Extending to more than one variable =====

Newton's method can be generalized to systems of several non-linear equations
and variables. Consider the case with two equations
!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} f_1(x_1,x_2) &=0\\
                     f_2(x_1,x_2) &=0,\end{array}
\]
!et
which we Taylor expand to obtain

!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} 0=f_1(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_1(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_2+\dots\\
                     0=f_2(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_2(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_2+\dots
                       \end{array}.
\]
!et
Defining the Jacobian matrix ${\bf \bm{J}}$ we have
!bt
\[
 {\bf \bm{J}}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
                         \partial f_1/\partial x_1  & \partial f_1/\partial x_2 \\
                          \partial f_2/\partial x_1     &\partial f_2/\partial x_2
             \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
we can rephrase Newton's method as
!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n+1} \\ x_2^{n+1} \end{array} \right)=
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n} \\ x_2^{n} \end{array} \right)+
\left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
   \left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right)=
   -{\bf \bm{J}}^{-1}
   \left(\begin{array}{c} f_1(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \\ f_2(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \end{array} \right).
\]
!et
We need thus to compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix and it
is to understand that difficulties  may
arise in case ${\bf \bm{J}}$ is nearly singular.

It is rather straightforward to extend the above scheme to systems of
more than two non-linear equations. In our case, the Jacobian matrix is given by the Hessian that represents the second derivative of cost function. 




===== Steepest descent =====

The basic idea of gradient descent is
that a function $F(\mathbf{x})$, 
$\mathbf{x} \equiv (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, decreases fastest if one goes from $\bf {x}$ in the
direction of the negative gradient $-\nabla F(\mathbf{x})$.

It can be shown that if 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k),
\]
!et
with $\gamma_k > 0$.

For $\gamma_k$ small enough, then $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$. This means that for a sufficiently small $\gamma_k$
we are always moving towards smaller function values, i.e a minimum.

 
===== More on Steepest descent =====

The previous observation is the basis of the method of steepest
descent, which is also referred to as just gradient descent (GD). One
starts with an initial guess $\mathbf{x}_0$ for a minimum of $F$ and
computes new approximations according to

!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k), \ \ k \geq 0.
\]
!et

The parameter $\gamma_k$ is often referred to as the step length or
the learning rate within the context of Machine Learning.

 
===== The ideal =====

Ideally the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k \}_{k=0}$ converges to a global
minimum of the function $F$. In general we do not know if we are in a
global or local minimum. In the special case when $F$ is a convex
function, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case
gradient descent can converge to the global solution. The advantage of
this scheme is that it is conceptually simple and straightforward to
implement. However the method in this form has some severe
limitations:

In machine learing we are often faced with non-convex high dimensional
cost functions with many local minima. Since GD is deterministic we
will get stuck in a local minimum, if the method converges, unless we
have a very good intial guess. This also implies that the scheme is
sensitive to the chosen initial condition.

Note that the gradient is a function of $\mathbf{x} =
(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ which makes it expensive to compute numerically.


 
===== The sensitiveness of the gradient descent ===== 

The gradient descent method 
is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\gamma_k$. This is due
to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$ for sufficiently small $\gamma_k$. The problem is to
determine an optimal learning rate. If the learning rate is chosen too
small the method will take a long time to converge and if it is too
large we can experience erratic behavior.

Many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by introducing
randomness. One such method is that of Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), see below.


 
===== Convex functions ===== 

Ideally we want our cost/loss function to be convex(concave).

First we give the definition of a convex set: A set $C$ in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be convex if, for all $x$ and $y$ in $C$ and
all $t \in (0,1)$ , the point $(1 − t)x + ty$ also belongs to
C. Geometrically this means that every point on the line segment
connecting $x$ and $y$ is in $C$ as discussed below.

The convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals of
$\mathbb{R}$. Examples of convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are the
regular polygons (triangles, rectangles, pentagons, etc...).


===== Convex function =====

_Convex function_: Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex set. Assume that the function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is said to be convex if $$f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) $$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and for all $t \in [0,1]$. If $\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $t\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.


===== Conditions on convex functions =====

In the following we state first and second-order conditions which
ensures convexity of a function $f$. We write $D_f$ to denote the
domain of $f$, i.e the subset of $R^n$ where $f$ is defined. For more
details and proofs we refer to: "S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Convex Optimization. Cambridge University Press":"http://stanford.edu/boyd/cvxbook/, 2004".

!bblock First order condition
Suppose $f$ is differentiable (i.e $\nabla f(x)$ is well defined for
all $x$ in the domain of $f$). Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$
is a convex set and $$f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y-x) $$ holds
for all $x,y \in D_f$. This condition means that for a convex function
the first order Taylor expansion (right hand side above) at any point
a global under estimator of the function. To convince yourself you can
make a drawing of $f(x) = x^2+1$ and draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ and
note that it is always below the graph.  
!eblock

!bblock Second order condition 
Assume that $f$ is twice
differentiable, i.e the Hessian matrix exists at each point in
$D_f$. Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$ is a convex set and its
Hessian is positive semi-definite for all $x\in D_f$. For a
single-variable function this reduces to $f''(x) \geq 0$. Geometrically this means that $f$ has nonnegative curvature
everywhere.
!eblock

This condition is particularly useful since it gives us an procedure for determining if the function under consideration is convex, apart from using the definition.


===== More on convex functions =====

The next result is of great importance to us and the reason why we are
going on about convex functions. In machine learning we frequently
have to minimize a loss/cost function in order to find the best
parameters for the model we are considering. 

Ideally we want the
global minimum (for high-dimensional models it is hard to know
if we have local or global minimum). However, if the cost/loss function
is convex the following result provides invaluable information:

!bblock Any minimum is global for convex functions
Consider the problem of finding $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(x)$
is minimal, where $f$ is convex and differentiable. Then, any point
$x^*$ that satisfies $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ is a global minimum.
!eblock

This result means that if we know that the cost/loss function is convex and we are able to find a minimum, we are guaranteed that it is a global minimum.


===== Some simple problems =====

o Show that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ using the definition of convexity. Hint: If you re-write the definition, $f$ is convex if the following holds for all $x,y \in D_f$ and any $\lambda \in [0,1]$ $\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)-f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y ) \geq 0$.

o Using the second order condition show that the following functions are convex on the specified domain.
 * $f(x) = e^x$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $g(x) = -\ln(x)$ is convex for $x \in (0,\infty)$.
o Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = e^x$. Show that $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Also show that if $f(x)$ is any convex function than $h(x) = e^{f(x)}$ is convex.

o A norm is any function that satisfy the following properties
 * $f(\alpha x) = |\alpha| f(x)$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y)$
 * $f(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with equality if and only if $x = 0$

Using the definition of convexity, try to show that a function satisfying the properties above is convex (the third condition is not needed to show this).




 
===== Gradient descent example =====

Let $\mathbf{y} = (y_1,\cdots,y_n)^T$, $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = (\bm{y}_1,\cdots,\bm{y}_n)^T$ and $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1)^T$

It is convenient to write $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = X\beta$ where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{100 \times 2} $ is the design matrix given by (we keep the intercept here)
!bt
\[
X \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_1  \\
\vdots & \vdots  \\
1 & x_{100} &  \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
The cost/loss/risk function is given by (
!bt
\[
C(\beta) = \frac{1}{n}||X\beta-\mathbf{y}||_{2}^{2} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left[ (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)^2 - 2 y_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i) + y_i^2\right] 
\]
!et
and we want to find $\beta$ such that $C(\beta)$ is minimized.


===== The derivative of the cost/loss function =====

Computing $\partial C(\beta) / \partial \beta_0$ and $\partial C(\beta) / \partial \beta_1$ we can show  that the gradient can be written as
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\beta} C(\beta) = \frac{2}{n}\begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i=1}^{100} \left(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i-y_i\right) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left( x_i (\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)-y_ix_i\right) \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T(X\beta - \mathbf{y}), 
\]
!et
where $X$ is the design matrix defined above.


===== The Hessian matrix =====
The Hessian matrix of $C(\beta)$ is given by 
!bt
\[
\bm{H} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0^2} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0 \partial \beta_1}  \\
\frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0 \partial \beta_1} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_1^2} &  \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T X.
\]
!et
This result implies that $C(\beta)$ is a convex function since the matrix $X^T X$ always is positive semi-definite.





===== Simple program =====

We can now write a program that minimizes $C(\beta)$ using the gradient descent method with a constant learning rate $\gamma$ according to 
!bt
\[
\beta_{k+1} = \beta_k - \gamma \nabla_\beta C(\beta_k), \ k=0,1,\cdots 
\]
!et

We can use the expression we computed for the gradient and let use a
$\beta_0$ be chosen randomly and let $\gamma = 0.001$. Stop iterating
when $||\nabla_\beta C(\beta_k) || \leq \epsilon = 10^{-8}$. _Note that the code below does not include the latter stop criterion_.

And finally we can compare our solution for $\beta$ with the analytic result given by 
$\beta= (X^TX)^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y}$.

===== Using gradient descent methods, limitations =====

* _Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function_. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our cost/loss/risk function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.

* _GD is sensitive to initial conditions_. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.

* _Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets_. In many cases in statistics and ML, the cost/loss/risk function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \propto \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \mathbf{w}^T\cdot\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called ``mini batches''. This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.

* _GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates_. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.

* _GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly._ Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. 
	
* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.


===== Improving gradient descent with momentum =====

We discuss here some simple examples where we introduce what is called 'memory'about previous steps, or what is normally called momentum gradient descent. The mathematics is explained below in connection with Stochastic gradient descent.

===== Momentum based GD =====

The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is almost always used with a
*momentum* or inertia term that serves as a memory of the direction we
are moving in parameter space.  This is typically implemented as
follows

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}_{t}&=\gamma \mathbf{v}_{t-1}+\eta_{t}\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t) \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&= \boldsymbol{\theta}_t -\mathbf{v}_{t},
\end{align}
!et

where we have introduced a momentum parameter $\gamma$, with
$0\le\gamma\le 1$, and for brevity we dropped the explicit notation to
indicate the gradient is to be taken over a different mini-batch at
each step. We call this algorithm gradient descent with momentum
(GDM). From these equations, it is clear that $\mathbf{v}_t$ is a
running average of recently encountered gradients and
$(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ sets the characteristic time scale for the memory
used in the averaging procedure. Consistent with this, when
$\gamma=0$, this just reduces down to ordinary SGD as discussed
earlier. An equivalent way of writing the updates is

!bt
\[
\Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \gamma \Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_t -\ \eta_{t}\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t),
\]
!et
where we have defined $\Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}= \boldsymbol{\theta}_t-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}$.


===== More on momentum based approaches =====

Let us try to get more intuition from these equations. It is helpful
to consider a simple physical analogy with a particle of mass $m$
moving in a viscous medium with drag coefficient $\mu$ and potential
$E(\mathbf{w})$. If we denote the particle's position by $\mathbf{w}$,
then its motion is described by

!bt
\[
m {d^2 \mathbf{w} \over dt^2} + \mu {d \mathbf{w} \over dt }= -\nabla_w E(\mathbf{w}).
\]
!et

We can discretize this equation in the usual way to get

!bt
\[
m { \mathbf{w}_{t+\Delta t}-2 \mathbf{w}_{t} +\mathbf{w}_{t-\Delta t} \over (\Delta t)^2}+\mu {\mathbf{w}_{t+\Delta t}- \mathbf{w}_{t} \over \Delta t} = -\nabla_w E(\mathbf{w}).
\]
!et

Rearranging this equation, we can rewrite this as

!bt
\[
\Delta \mathbf{w}_{t +\Delta t}= - { (\Delta t)^2 \over m +\mu \Delta t} \nabla_w E(\mathbf{w})+ {m \over m +\mu \Delta t} \Delta \mathbf{w}_t.
\]
!et


===== Momentum parameter =====

Notice that this equation is identical to previous one if we identify
the position of the particle, $\mathbf{w}$, with the parameters
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$. This allows us to identify the momentum
parameter and learning rate with the mass of the particle and the
viscous drag as:

!bt
\[
\gamma= {m \over m +\mu \Delta t }, \qquad \eta = {(\Delta t)^2 \over m +\mu \Delta t}.
\]
!et

Thus, as the name suggests, the momentum parameter is proportional to
the mass of the particle and effectively provides inertia.
Furthermore, in the large viscosity/small learning rate limit, our
memory time scales as $(1-\gamma)^{-1} \approx m/(\mu \Delta t)$.

Why is momentum useful? SGD momentum helps the gradient descent
algorithm gain speed in directions with persistent but small gradients
even in the presence of stochasticity, while suppressing oscillations
in high-curvature directions. This becomes especially important in
situations where the landscape is shallow and flat in some directions
and narrow and steep in others. It has been argued that first-order
methods (with appropriate initial conditions) can perform comparable
to more expensive second order methods, especially in the context of
complex deep learning models.

These beneficial properties of momentum can sometimes become even more
pronounced by using a slight modification of the classical momentum
algorithm called Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG).

In the NAG algorithm, rather than calculating the gradient at the
current parameters, $\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)$, one
calculates the gradient at the expected value of the parameters given
our current momentum, $\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t +\gamma
\mathbf{v}_{t-1})$. This yields the NAG update rule

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}_{t}&=\gamma \mathbf{v}_{t-1}+\eta_{t}\nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}_t +\gamma \mathbf{v}_{t-1}) \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&= \boldsymbol{\theta}_t -\mathbf{v}_{t}.
\end{align}
!et

One of the major advantages of NAG is that it allows for the use of a larger learning rate than GDM for the same choice of $\gamma$.



===== Second moment of the gradient =====


In stochastic gradient descent, with and without momentum, we still
have to specify a schedule for tuning the learning rates $\eta_t$
as a function of time.  As discussed in the context of Newton's
method, this presents a number of dilemmas. The learning rate is
limited by the steepest direction which can change depending on the
current position in the landscape. To circumvent this problem, ideally
our algorithm would keep track of curvature and take large steps in
shallow, flat directions and small steps in steep, narrow directions.
Second-order methods accomplish this by calculating or approximating
the Hessian and normalizing the learning rate by the
curvature. However, this is very computationally expensive for
extremely large models. Ideally, we would like to be able to
adaptively change the step size to match the landscape without paying
the steep computational price of calculating or approximating
Hessians.

Recently, a number of methods have been introduced that accomplish
this by tracking not only the gradient, but also the second moment of
the gradient. These methods include AdaGrad, AdaDelta, Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMS-Prop), and
"ADAM":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980".


===== RMS prop =====

In RMS prop, in addition to keeping a running average of the first
moment of the gradient, we also keep track of the second moment
denoted by $\mathbf{s}_t=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g}_t^2]$. The update rule
for RMS prop is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{g}_t &= \nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
\mathbf{s}_t &=\beta \mathbf{s}_{t-1} +(1-\beta)\mathbf{g}_t^2 \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&=&\boldsymbol{\theta}_t - \eta_t { \mathbf{g}_t \over \sqrt{\mathbf{s}_t +\epsilon}}, \nonumber
\end{align}
!et

where $\beta$ controls the averaging time of the second moment and is
typically taken to be about $\beta=0.9$, $\eta_t$ is a learning rate
typically chosen to be $10^{-3}$, and $\epsilon\sim 10^{-8} $ is a
small regularization constant to prevent divergences. Multiplication
and division by vectors is understood as an element-wise operation. It
is clear from this formula that the learning rate is reduced in
directions where the norm of the gradient is consistently large. This
greatly speeds up the convergence by allowing us to use a larger
learning rate for flat directions.



===== "ADAM optimizer":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980" =====

A related algorithm is the ADAM optimizer. In
"ADAM":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980", we keep a running average of
both the first and second moment of the gradient and use this
information to adaptively change the learning rate for different
parameters.  The method isefficient when working with large
problems involving lots data and/or parameters.  It is a combination of the
gradient descent with momentum algorithm and the RMSprop algorithm
discussed above.

In addition to keeping a running average of the first and
second moments of the gradient
(i.e. $\mathbf{m}_t=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g}_t]$ and
$\mathbf{s}_t=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g}^2_t]$, respectively), ADAM
performs an additional bias correction to account for the fact that we
are estimating the first two moments of the gradient using a running
average (denoted by the hats in the update rule below). The update
rule for ADAM is given by (where multiplication and division are once
again understood to be element-wise operations below)

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{g}_t &= \nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
\mathbf{m}_t &= \beta_1 \mathbf{m}_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) \mathbf{g}_t \nonumber \\
\mathbf{s}_t &=\beta_2 \mathbf{s}_{t-1} +(1-\beta_2)\mathbf{g}_t^2 \nonumber \\
\bm{\mathbf{m}}_t&={\mathbf{m}_t \over 1-\beta_1^t} \nonumber \\
\bm{\mathbf{s}}_t &={\mathbf{s}_t \over1-\beta_2^t} \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&=\boldsymbol{\theta}_t - \eta_t { \bm{\mathbf{m}}_t \over \sqrt{\bm{\mathbf{s}}_t} +\epsilon}, \nonumber \\
\end{align}
!et

where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ set the memory lifetime of the first and
second moment and are typically taken to be $0.9$ and $0.99$
respectively, and $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ are identical to RMSprop.

Like in RMSprop, the effective step size of a parameter depends on the
magnitude of its gradient squared.  To understand this better, let us
rewrite this expression in terms of the variance
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_t^2 = \bm{\mathbf{s}}_t -
(\bm{\mathbf{m}}_t)^2$. Consider a single parameter $\theta_t$. The
update rule for this parameter is given by

!bt
\[
\Delta \theta_{t+1}= -\eta_t { \bm{m}_t \over \sqrt{\sigma_t^2 +  m_t^2 }+\epsilon}.
\]
!et


===== Algorithms and codes for Adagrad, RMSprop and Adam =====

The algorithms we have implemented are well described in the text by "Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, chapter 8":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/optimization.html".

The codes which implement these algorithms are discussed after our presentation of automatic differentiation.



===== Practical tips =====

* _Randomize the data when making mini-batches_. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.

* _Transform your inputs_. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.

* _Monitor the out-of-sample performance._ Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.
	
* _Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization._ Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.



=====  Using Autograd with OLS =====

We conclude the part on optmization by showing how we can make codes
for linear regression and logistic regression using _autograd_. The
first example shows results with ordinary leats squares.

===== Introducing "JAX":"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" =====

Presently, instead of using _autograd_, we recommend using "JAX":"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"

_JAX_ is Autograd and "XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra))":"https://www.tensorflow.org/xla",
brought together for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research.
It provides composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize, parallelize, Just-In-Time compile to GPU/TPU, and more.

Here's a simple example on how you can use _JAX_ to compute the derivate of the logistic function.

def sum_logistic(x):
  return jnp.sum(1.0 / (1.0 + jnp.exp(-x)))

efficient implementations of gradient methods to the derivatives of
the Hamiltonian expectation values.

e0 = 0.0

===== A smarter way of doing this =====

The above approach means that we are setting up several matrix-matrix
and matrix-vector multiplications. Although straight forward it is not
the most efficient way of doing this, in particular in case the
matrices become large (and sparse). But there are some more important
issues.

In a physical realization of these systems we cannot just multiply the
state with the Hamiltonian. When performing a measurement we can only
measure in one particular direction. For the computational basis
states which we have, $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$, we have
to measure along the bases of the Pauli matrices and reconstruct the
eigenvalues from these measurements.

From our earlier discussions we know that the Pauli $Z$ matrix has the above basis states as eigen states through

!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_z\vert 0 \rangle = \bm{Z}\vert 0 \rangle=+1\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_z\vert 1 \rangle = \bm{Z}\vert 1 \rangle=-1\vert 1 \rangle,
\]
!et
with eigenvalue $-1$.

For the Pauli $X$ matrix on the other hand we have
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_x\vert 0 \rangle = \bm{X}\vert 0 \rangle=+1\vert 1 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_x\vert 1 \rangle = \bm{X}\vert 1 \rangle=-1\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et

with eigenvalues $1$ in both cases. The latter two equations tell us
that the computational basis we have chosen, and in which we will
prepare our states, is not an eigenbasis of the $\sigma_x$ matrix.

We will thus try to rewrite the Pauli $X$ matrix in terms of a Pauli $Z$ matrix. Fortunately this can be done using the Hadamard matrix twice, that is

!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\bm{\sigma}_x=\bm{H}\bm{Z}\bm{H}.
\]
!et

The Pauli $Y$ matrix can be written as

!bt
\[
\bm{Y}=\bm{\sigma}_y=\bm{H}\bm{S}^{\dagger}\bm{Z}\bm{H}\bm{S},
\]
!et

where $S$ is the phase matrix
!bt
\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \imath \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et




From here and on we will denote the Pauli matrices by $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ and we can write the expectation value of the Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert (c+\mathcal{E})\bm{I} + (\Omega+\omega_z)\bm{Z} + \omega_x\bm{H}\bm{Z}\bm{H}\vert \psi \rangle,
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as
!bt
\[
(c+\mathcal{E})\langle \psi \vert \bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle+(\Omega+\omega_z)\langle \psi \vert \bm{Z}\vert \psi \rangle+\omega_x\langle \psi \bm{H}\vert \bm{Z}\vert\bm{H}\psi \rangle.
\]
!et

The first and second term are to easy to perform a measurement on since we we just need to compute
$\langle \psi\vert \bm{I}\vert \psi\rangle$ and $\langle \psi\vert \bm{Z}\vert \psi\rangle$.
For the final term we need just to add the action of the Hadamard matrix and we are done.

_To do:_ Set up codes for this using gradient descent and perform a series of measumerents



===== Two-qubit system and the VQE =====


We extend now the system  to a two-qubit system with the following computational
basis states and Hamiltonian matrix written out in terms of Pauli spin
matrices.

This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

===== Moving to the Lipkin model =====



To construct an efficient ansatz, we must determine the subspace
within which the Hamiltonian lives. To begin, note that particles are
only ever moved between energy levels in pairs. This implies that all
possible states have a Hamming weight of constant parity (odd or
even); this is the same as the signature $r$ being conserved. Further,
note that the Hamiltonian's coefficients ($\epsilon$ and $V$) are
state independent (do not depend on the indices $n$ or $m$) as the
states labeled by these indices are degenerate and thus have the same
energy level. Thus, the Hamiltonian treats all states with the same
number of excited particles (Hamming weight of the state) as the
same. Therefore, the following ansatz forms exactly cover the subspace
within which the $N$-degenerate Hamiltonian explores:

!bt
\begin{align}
\vert \psi_{\text{even}}\rangle&=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}c_{2k}\vert D^n_{2k}\rangle,
\\
\vert \psi_{\text{odd}}\rangle&=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}c_{2k+1}\vert D^n_{2k+1}\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

Here $\vert D^n_k\rangle$ represents a Dicke state which is defined as equal superposition of all $n$-qubit states with Hamming weight $k$. That is

!bt
\begin{align}
\vert D^n_k\rangle= \frac{1}{\sqrt{{n \choose k}}}\sum_{x\in h^n_k}\vert x\rangle,
\end{align}
!et

where $h^n_k= \{\vert x\rangle \ | \ \text{l}(x) = n, \ \text{wt}(x) = k\}$. There are two ways we can think of to prepare such ansatz: The first is to prepare them exactly as it is known how to deterministically prepare Dicke states with linear depth. The reference provides an algorithm for preparing a set of gates $U^n_k$ that prepares a Dicke state from a product state of Hamming weight $k$; that is
!bt
\begin{align}
U^n_k\vert 1\rangle^{\otimes k}\vert 0\rangle^{\otimes n-k}=\vert D^n_k\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

It then describes how to one can create an arbitrary superposition of
Dicke states, which we modify here to restrict ourselves to a Hamming
weight of constant parity. The circuit to construct such a state (for
the $k=6$ case, as an example) is given below

  o Optimizer
  o Quantum instance (i.e. which backend). Here we will be using the "qasm_simulator"

To define the Hamiltonian, we will use the Qiskit Pauli operator functions

$\theta$ from $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and picking out the
minimum energy value
