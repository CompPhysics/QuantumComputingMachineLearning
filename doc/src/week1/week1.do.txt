===== Linear Algebra and quantum mechanical states =====

There are several central software packages for linear algebra and
eigenvalue problems. Several of the more popular ones have been
wrapped into ofter software packages like those from the widely used
text _Numerical Recipes_. The original source codes in many of the
available packages are often taken from the widely used software
package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages developed in
the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.  We describe them shortly here.

  * LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.
  * LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website URL: "http://www.netlib.org" it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.
  * BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from URL: "http://www.netlib.org".

When dealing with matrices and vectors a central issue is memory
handling and allocation. If our code is written in Python the way we
declare these objects and the way they are handled, interpreted and
used by say a linear algebra library, requires codes that interface
our Python program with such libraries. For Python programmers,
_Numpy_ is by now the standard Python package for numerical arrays in
Python as well as the source of functions which act on these
arrays. These functions span from eigenvalue solvers to functions that
compute the mean value, variance or the covariance matrix. If you are
not familiar with how arrays are handled in say Python or compiled
languages like C++ and Fortran, the sections in this chapter may be
useful. For C++ programmer, _Armadillo_ is widely used library for
linear algebra and eigenvalue problems. In addition it offers a
convenient way to handle and organize arrays. We discuss this library
as well.   Before we proceed we believe  it may be convenient to repeat some basic features of 
 matrices and vectors.

\[
 \mathbf{A} =
      \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
                                 a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\
                                   a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
                                  a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44}
             \end{bmatrix}\qquad
\mathbf{I} =
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                                 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                                 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                                 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
             \end{bmatrix}

\]
!et



 $A = A^{T}$          symmetric        $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$           
 $A = \left (A^{T} \right )^{-1}$  real orthogonal  $\sum_k a_{ik} a_{jk} = \sum_k a_{ki} a_{kj} = \delta_{ij}$ 
 $A = A^{ * }$           real matrix      $a_{ij} = a_{ij}^{ * }$      
 $A = A^{\dagger}$       hermitian      $a_{ij} = a_{ji}^{ * }$       
 $A = \left (A^{\dagger} \right )^{-1}$  unitary | $\sum_k a_{ik} a_{jk}^{ * } = \sum_k a_{ki}^{ * } a_{kj} = \delta_{ij}$ 

  * Diagonal if $a_{ij}=0$ for $i\ne j$
  * Upper triangular if $a_{ij}=0$ for $i > j$
  * Lower triangular if $a_{ij}=0$ for $i < j$
  * Upper Hessenberg if $a_{ij}=0$ for $i > j+1$
  * Lower Hessenberg if $a_{ij}=0$ for $i < j+1$
  * Tridiagonal if $a_{ij}=0$ for $|i -j| > 1$
  * Lower banded with bandwidth $p$: $a_{ij}=0$ for $i > j+p$
  * Upper banded with bandwidth $p$: $a_{ij}=0$ for $i < j+p$
  * Banded, block upper triangular, block lower triangular....


Some Equivalent Statements. For an $N\times N$ matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ the following properties are all equivalent

  * If the inverse of $\mathbf{A}$ exists, $\mathbf{A}$ is nonsingular.
  * The equation $\mathbf{Ax}=0$ implies $\mathbf{x}=0$.
  * The rows of $\mathbf{A}$ form a basis of $R^N$.
  * The columns of $\mathbf{A}$ form a basis of $R^N$.
  * $\mathbf{A}$ is a product of elementary matrices.
  * $0$ is not eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}$.

===== Numpy and arrays =====
"Numpy":"http://www.numpy.org/" provides an easy way to handle arrays in Python. The standard way to import this library is as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
print(x)
!ec
Here we have defined a vector $x$ with $n=10$ elements with its values given by the Normal distribution $N(0,1)$.
Another alternative is to declare a vector as follows
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x)
!ec
Here we have defined a vector with three elements, with $x_0=1$, $x_1=2$ and $x_2=3$. Note that both Python and C++
start numbering array elements from $0$ and on. This means that a vector with $n$ elements has a sequence of entities $x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}$. We could also let (recommended) Numpy to compute the logarithms of a specific array as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8]))
print(x)
!ec

Here we have used Numpy's unary function $np.log$. This function is
highly tuned to compute array elements since the code is vectorized
and does not require looping. We normaly recommend that you use the
Numpy intrinsic functions instead of the corresponding _log_ function
from Python's _math_ module. The looping is done explicitely by the
_np.log_ function. The alternative, and slower way to compute the
logarithms of a vector would be to write

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
from math import log
x = np.array([4, 7, 8])
for i in range(0, len(x)):
    x[i] = log(x[i])
print(x)
!ec
We note that our code is much longer already and we need to import the _log_ function from the _math_ module. 
The attentive reader will also notice that the output is $[1, 1, 2]$. Python interprets automacally our numbers as integers (like the _automatic_ keyword in C++). To change this we could define our array elements to be double precision numbers as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8], dtype = np.float64))
print(x)
!ec
or simply write them as double precision numbers (Python uses 64 bits as default for floating point type variables), that is
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x)
!ec
To check the number of bytes (remember that one byte contains eight bits for double precision variables), you can use simple use the _itemsize_ functionality (the array $x$ is actually an object which inherits the functionalities defined in Numpy) as 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x.itemsize)
!ec

Having defined vectors, we are now ready to try out matrices. We can define a $3 \times 3 $ real matrix $\hat{A}$
as (recall that we user lowercase letters for vectors and uppercase letters for matrices)
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
print(A)
!ec
If we use the _shape_ function we would get $(3, 3)$ as output, that is verifying that our matrix is a $3\times 3$ matrix. We can slice the matrix and print for example the first column (Python organized matrix elements in a row-major order, see below) as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[:,0]) 
!ec
We can continue this was by printing out other columns or rows. The example here prints out the second column
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[1,:]) 
!ec 
Numpy contains many other functionalities that allow us to slice, subdivide etc etc arrays. We strongly recommend that you look up the "Numpy website for more details":"http://www.numpy.org/". Useful functions when defining a matrix are the _np.zeros_ function which declares a matrix of a given dimension and sets all elements to zero
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to zero
A = np.zeros( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or initializing all elements to 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to one
A = np.ones( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or as unitarily distributed random numbers (see the material on random number generators in the statistics part)
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to random numbers with x \in [0, 1]
A = np.random.rand(n, n)
print(A) 
!ec 


===== Defining basis states and quantum mechanical operators =====

We start by defining a state vector $\bm{x}$ (meant to represent
various quantum mechanical degrees of freedom) with $n$ components as

!bt
\[
\bm{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0\\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Throughout these notes we will use the so-called Dirac _\bra-ket_
formalism and we will replace the above standard boldfaced notation
for a vector with

!bt
\[
\bm{x} = \vert x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} x_0\\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{x}^{\dagger} = \langle x \vert = \begin{bmatrix} x_0^* \\ x_1^* \\ x_2^* \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1}^* \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

With a given vector $\vert x \rangle$, we define the inner product as
!bt
\[
\langle x \vert x\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^*x_i=x_0^2+x_1^2+\dots + x_{n-1}^2. 
\]
!et

For two arbitrary vectors $\vert x\rangle$ and $\vert y\rangle$ with the same lentgh, we have the
general expression
!bt
\[
\langle y \vert x\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_i^*x_i=y_0^*x_0+y_1^*x_1+\dots + y_{n-1}^*x_{n-1}. 
\]
!et

Note well that the inner product $\langle x \vert x\rangle$ is always a real number while for a two different vectors $\langle y \vert x\rangle$ is in general not equal to
$\langle x \vert y\rangle$, as can be seen from the following example






* Definition of vectors with bra and ket formalism
* Definition of states
* Superposition
* Inner products
* Outer products and projecttion operators
* Eigenvalues and spectral decomposition
* Fourier expansions
* Density matrix
