=== Shannon information entropy ===


We define a set of random variables $X=\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ with
probability for an outcome $x\in X$ given by $p_X(x)$, the information
entropy is defined as

!bt
\[
S=-\sum_{x\in X}p_X(x)\log_2{p_X(x)}.
\]
!et

=== Von Neumann entropy ===

!bt
\[
S=-\mathrm{Tr}[\rho\log_2{\rho}].
\]
!et



=== Two-qubit system and definition of density matrices  ===

This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\] 
!et

The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is

!bt
\[
\rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11 \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.


We can
then in turn define the density matrix for the subsets $A$ or $B$ as

!bt
\[
\rho_A=\mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho_{0})=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{B}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{B},
\]
!et

or

!bt
\[
\rho_B=\mathrm{Tr}_A(\rho_0)=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{A}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{A}.
\]
!et

The density matrices for these subsets can be used to compute the
so-called von Neumann entropy, which is one of the possible measures
of entanglement. A pure state has entropy equal zero while entangled
state have an entropy larger than zero. The von-Neumann entropy is
defined as

!bt
\[
S(A,B)=-\mathrm{Tr}\left(\rho_{A,B}\log_2 (\rho_{A,B})\right).
\]
!et

The example here shows the above von Neumann entropy based on the
density matrix for the lowest many-body state. We see clearly a jump
in the entropy around the point where we have a level crossing. At
interaction strenght $\lambda=0$ we have many-body states purely
defined by their computational basis states. As we switch on the
interaction strength, we obtain an increased degree of mixing and the
entropy increases till we reach the level crossing point where we see
an additional and sudden increase in entropy. Similar behaviors are
observed for the other states. The most important result from this
example is that entanglement is driven by the Hamiltonian itself and
the strength of the interaction matrix elements and the
non-interacting energies.

===== Quantum gates, circuits and simple algorithms =====


Quantum gates are physical actions that are applied to the physical
system representing the qubits. Mathematically, they are
complex-valued, unitary matrices which act on the complex-values
normalized vectors that represent qubits. As the quantum analog of
classical logic gates (such as AND and OR), there is a corresponding
quantum gate for every classical gate; however, there are quantum
gates that have no classical counter-part. They act on a set of qubits
and, changing their state. That is, if $U$ is a quantum gate and
$\vert q \rangle $ is a qubit, then acting the gate $U$ on the qubit $\vert q \rangle $
transforms the qubit as follows:

!bt
\begin{align}
\vert q \rangle \overset{U}{\to}U\vert q \rangle 
.\end{align}
!et

This action would be represented as the following quantum circuit

!bt
\begin{align}
label{simple_qc}
\Qcircuit
{
\lstick{\vert q \rangle } & \gate{U} & \rstick{U\vert q \rangle } \qw 
}
\end{align}
!et

Quantum circuits are diagrammatic representations of quantum
algorithms. The horizontal dimension corresponds to time; moving left
to right corresponds to forward motion in time. They consist of a set
of qubits $\vert q_n\rangle$ which are stacked vertically on the left-hand
side of the diagram. Lines, called quantum wires, extend horizontally
to the right from each qubit, representing its state moving forward in
time. Additionally, they contain a set of quantum gates that are
applied to the quantum wires. Gates are applied chronologically, left
to right. With this, we can see that the quantum circuit above
(ref{simple_qc}) implies that the quantum gate $U$ is being applied
to the qubit in state $\vert q \rangle$.

To explain what quantum circuits represent mathematically, consider the following circuit

!bt
\begin{align}
label{simple_qce}
\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=1em
{
\lstick{\vert q_0 \rangle } & \gate{A} & \gate{B} & \qw 
\\
\lstick{\vert q_1 \rangle } & \gate{C} & \gate{D} & \qw 
}
\end{align}
!et
This circuit implies the following mathematical statement
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert q_0q_1\rangle
&\to
(B\otimes D)(A\otimes C)\vert q_0q_1\rangle
\\
&\to
(BA)\otimes(DC)\vert q_0q_1\rangle
\\
&\to 
BA\vert q_0 \rangle DC\vert q_1 \rangle 
.\end{align}
!et


Note that the mathematical form is in reverse order from circuit form
($AB\leftrightarrow BA$). This is because the operator closest to the
state (furthest to the right) acts first. Additionally, we are able to
write the actions of the top two gates and the bottom two as acting
separately on each qubit as every gate here is a single-qubit gate
(acting on only one qubit). The same would not be true for certain
two-qubit gates which would entangle the states of the two qubits, not
allowing their state to be written in a separable form. Finally, we
define the depth of a quantum circuit as the number of columns of
gates. The circuit above thus has a depth of 2 because it contains two
columns of gates, namely $A\otimes C$ and $B\otimes D$.

=== Single-Qubit Gates ===

A single-qubit gate is a physical action that is applied to one qubit. It can be represented by a matrix $U$ from the group SU(2). Any single-qubit gate can be parameterized by three angles: $\theta$, $\phi$, and $\lambda$ as follows

!bt
\begin{align}
label{U}
U(\theta,\phi,\lambda)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -e^{i\lambda}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}
\\
e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & e^{i(\phi+\lambda)}\cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
.\end{align}
!et

There are several widely used quantum gates, include the following:
The Pauli gates correspond to the Pauli matrices

!bt
\begin{align}
I
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\\
X
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\\
Y
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\\
Z
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
,\end{align}
!et

which satisfy the relation

!bt
\begin{align}
\comm{\sigma}{\tau}=i\epsilon_{\sigma\tau\upsilon}\upsilon
,\end{align}
!et

for $\sigma,\tau,\upsilon\in\{X,Y,Z\}$. These gates form a basis for
the algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. Exponentiating them will thus give us
a basis for SU(2), the group within which all single-qubit gates
live. These exponentiated Pauli gates are called rotation gates
$R_{\sigma}(\theta)$ because they rotate the quantum state around the
axis $\sigma=X,Y,Z$ of the Bloch sphere by an angle $\theta$. They are
defined as

!bt
\begin{align}
R_X(\theta)
&=
e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}X}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -i\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
-i\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & \cos\frac{\theta}{2} 
\end{pmatrix},
\\
R_Y(\theta)
&=
e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}Y}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & \cos\frac{\theta}{2} 
\end{pmatrix},
\\
R_Z(\theta)
&=
e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}Z}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\
0 & e^{i\theta/2}
\end{pmatrix}
.\end{align}
!et

Because they form a basis for $\text{SU}(2)$, any single-qubit gate can be decomposed into three rotation gates. Indeed

!bt
\begin{align}
R_z(\phi)R_y(\theta)R_z(\lambda)
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-i\phi/2} & 0 \\
0 & e^{i\phi/2}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\
\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & \cos\frac{\theta}{2} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-i\lambda/2} & 0 \\
0 & e^{i\lambda/2}
\end{pmatrix}
\\
&=
e^{-i(\phi+\lambda)/2}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -e^{i\lambda}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}
\\
e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & e^{i(\phi+\lambda)}\cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
,\end{align}
!et

which is, up to a global phase, equal to the expression for an arbitrary single-qubit gate (ref{U}).

=== Two-Qubit Gates ===

A two-qubit gate is a physical action that is applied to two
qubits. It can be represented by a matrix $U$ from the group
SU(4). One important type of two-qubit gates are controlled gates,
which work as follows: Suppose $U$ is a single-qubit gate. A
controlled-$U$ gate ($CU$) acts on two qubits: a control qubit
$\vert x \rangle $ and a target qubit $\vert y \rangle $. The controlled-$U$ gate
applies the identity $I$ or the single-qubit gate $U$ to the target
qubit if the control gate is in the zero state $\ket{0}$ or the one
state $\ket{1}$, respectively. The control qubit is not acted
upon. This can be represented as follows:

!bt
\begin{align}
CU\ket{xy}=
\begin{cases}
\ket{xy} & \text{if} \ \vert x \rangle =\ket{0}
\\
\vert x \rangle U\vert y \rangle  & \text{if} \ \vert x \rangle =\ket{1}
\end{cases}
.\end{align}
!et
The action of a controlled-$U$ gate $CU$ can be represented in a quantum circuit as follows

!bt
\begin{align}
\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=3em 
{
\lstick{\vert x \rangle } & \ctrl{1} & \rstick{\vert x \rangle } \qw
\\
\lstick{\vert y \rangle } & \gate{U} & \rstick{\begin{cases}\vert y \rangle , & \vert x \rangle =\ket{0} \\ U\vert y \rangle , & \ket{a}=\vert x \rangle \end{cases}} \qw
}
\\
\nonumber
\end{align}
!et


It can be written in matrix form by writing it as a superposition of
the two possible cases, each written as a simple tensor product

!bt
\begin{align}
CU 
&= \ket{0}\bra{0}\otimes I + \ket{1}\bra{1}\otimes U
\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & u_{00} & u_{01} \\
0 & 0 & u_{10} & u_{11}
\end{pmatrix}
.\end{align}
!et

One of the most fundamental controlled gates is the CNOT gate. It is
defined as the controlled-$X$ gate $CX$ and thus flips the state of
the target qubit if the control qubit is in the zero state
$\ket{0}$. It can be written in matrix form as follows:

!bt
\begin{align}
\text{CNOT}
=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
.\end{align}
!et

A widely used two-qubit gate that goes beyond the simple controlled function is the SWAP gate. It swaps the states of the two qubits it acts upon

!bt
\begin{align}
\text{SWAP}\ket{xy}=\ket{yx}
,\end{align}
as depicted in the quantum circuit below
\begin{align}
label{swap_def}
\Qcircuit
{
\lstick{\vert x \rangle } & \qswap      & \rstick{\vert y \rangle } \qw
\\
\lstick{\vert y \rangle } & \qswap \qwx & \rstick{\vert x \rangle } \qw
}
,\end{align}
!et
and has the following matrix form

!bt
\begin{align}
\text{SWAP}
=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
.\end{align}
!et

It can be decomposed into a series of three CNOTs, each of which has its directionality flipped from the previous
!bt
\begin{align}
\Qcircuit
{
\lstick{\vert x \rangle } & \ctrl{1} & \targ     & \ctrl{1} & \rstick{\vert y \rangle } \qw
\\
\lstick{\vert y \rangle } & \targ    & \ctrl{-1} & \targ    & \rstick{\vert x \rangle } \qw
}
\end{align}
!et


As for arbitrary two-qubit gates $U\in\text{SU(4)}$, they can be
optimally decomposed (up to a global phase) into the following
sequence \cite{ref:kak} involving three parameters, fifteen elementary
one-qubit gates and three CNOT gates

!bt
\begin{align}
\Qcircuit
{
\qw & \gate{U_1} & \ctrl{1} & \gate{R_y(\theta_1)} & \targ      & \gate{R_y(\theta_2)} & \ctrl{1} & \gate{U_3} & \qw
\\
\qw & \gate{U_2} & \targ    & \gate{R_z(\theta_3)} & \ctrl{-1} & \qw                  & \targ     & \gate{U_4} & \qw
}
\end{align}
!et

where $U_1,U_2,U_3,U_4$ are single-qubit gates, each of which can be
decomposed into three elementary one-qubit gates (rotation
gates). Additionally, $\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3$ are parameters to
be determined by the arbitrary two-qubit gate to be
decomposed. Two-qubit gates that are restricted to $U\in\text{SO(4)}$
can be decomposed into a shorter depth circuit consisting of just
twelve elementary single-qubit gates and two CNOT gates

!bt
\begin{align}
\Qcircuit
{
\qw & \gate{R_z(\pi/2)} & \gate{R_y(\pi/2)} & \ctrl{1} & \gate{U_1} & \ctrl{1} & \gate{R^*_y(\pi/2)} & \gate{R^*_z(\pi/2)} & \qw
\\
\qw & \gate{R_z(\pi/2)} & \qw               & \targ    & \gate{U_2} & \targ    & \qw                 & \gate{R^*_z(\pi/2)} & \qw
}
\end{align}
!et
