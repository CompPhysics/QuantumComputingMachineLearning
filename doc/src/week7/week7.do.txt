===== Plans for the week of February 26-March 1 =====

!bblock
  o Reminder on basics of the VQE method and how to perform measurements for the simpler one- and two-qubit Hamiltonians
  o Simulating efficiently Hamiltonians on quantum computers with the VQE method and gradient descent to optimize the state function ansatz
  o Introducing the Lipkin model
  o "Reading suggestion, VQE review article":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157322003118?via%3Dihub"
