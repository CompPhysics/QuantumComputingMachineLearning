    "# Decision trees, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start here with the most basic algorithm, the so-called decision\n",
    "tree. With this basic algorithm we can in turn build more complex\n",
    "networks, spanning from homogeneous and heterogenous forests (bagging,\n",
    "random forests and more) to one of the most popular supervised\n",
    "algorithms nowadays, the extreme gradient boosting, or just\n",
    "XGBoost. But let us start with the simplest possible ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both,\n",
    "classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of decision trees\n",
    "is to find those descriptive features which contain the most\n",
    "**information** regarding the target feature and then split the dataset\n",
    "along the values of these features such that the target feature values\n",
    "for the resulting underlying datasets are as pure as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive features which reproduce best the target/output features are normally  said\n",
    "to be the most informative ones. The process of finding the **most\n",
    "informative** feature is done until we accomplish a stopping criteria\n",
    "where we then finally end up in so called **leaf nodes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics of a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is typically divided into a **root node**, the **interior nodes**,\n",
    "and the final **leaf nodes** or just **leaves**. These entities are then connected by so-called **branches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf nodes\n",
    "contain the predictions we will make for new query instances presented\n",
    "to our trained model. This is possible since the model has \n",
    "learned the underlying structure of the training data and hence can,\n",
    "given some assumptions, make predictions about the target feature value\n",
    "(class) of unseen query instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching approach to decision trees is a top-down approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A leaf provides the classification of a given instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A node specifies a test of some attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A branch corresponds to a possible values of an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An instance is classified by starting at the root node of the tree, testing the attribute specified by this node, then moving down the tree branch corresponding to the value of the attribute in the given example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is then repeated for the subtree rooted at the new\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplified terms, the process of training a decision tree and\n",
    "predicting the target features of query instances is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Present a dataset containing of a number of training instances characterized by a number of descriptive features and a target feature\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train the decision tree model by continuously splitting the target feature along the values of the descriptive features using a measure of information gain during the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grow the tree until we accomplish a stopping criteria create leaf nodes which represent the *predictions* we want to make for new query instances\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Show query instances to the tree and run down the tree until we arrive at leaf nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we are essentially done!"

    "that it is used to predict a qualitative response rather than a\n",
    "quantitative one. Recall that for a regression tree, the predicted\n",
    "response for an observation is given by the mean response of the\n",

    "\n",
    "* White box, easy to interpret model. Some people believe that decision trees more closely mirror human decision-making than do the regression and classification approaches discussed earlier (think of support vector machines)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees are very easy to explain to people. In fact, they are even easier to explain than linear regression!\n",
    "\n",
    "* No feature normalization needed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree models can handle both continuous and categorical data (Classification and Regression Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can model nonlinear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can model interactions between the different descriptive features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees can be displayed graphically, and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert (especially if they are small)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unfortunately, trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "* If continuous features are used the tree may become quite large and hence less interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees are prone to overfit the training data and hence do not well generalize the data if no stopping criteria or improvements like pruning, boosting or bagging are implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small changes in the data may lead to a completely different tree. This issue can be addressed by using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting or random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is *more easy* to split the dataset such that the sub datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by aggregating many decision trees, using methods like\n",
    "bagging, random forests, and boosting, the predictive performance of\n",
    "trees can be substantially improved."
