    "# Ensemble Methods: From a Single Tree to Many Trees and Extreme Boosting, Meet the Jungle of Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated previously and seen in many of the examples discussed in the previous chapter about\n",
    "a single decision tree, we often end up overfitting our training\n",
    "data. This normally means that we have a high variance. Can we reduce\n",
    "the variance of a statistical learning method?\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a set of different methods that can combine different\n",
    "machine learning algorithms or just use one of them to construct\n",
    "forests and jungles of trees, homogeneous ones or heterogenous\n",
    "ones. These methods are recognized by different names which we will\n",
    "try to explain here. These are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Voting classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bagging and Pasting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random forests\n",

    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "The **plain** decision trees suffer from high\n",
    "variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts\n",
    "at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we\n",
    "get could be quite different. In contrast, a procedure with low\n",
    "variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct\n",
    "data sets; linear regression tends to have low variance, if the ratio\n",
    "of $n$ to $p$ is moderately large. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap aggregation**, or just **bagging**, is a\n",
    "general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical\n",
    "learning method. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging typically results in improved accuracy\n",
    "over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the\n",
    "advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted\n",
    "diagram that results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer\n",
    "possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure\n",
    "using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are\n",
    "most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction\n",
    "accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection\n",
    "of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single\n",
    "tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each\n",
    "predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini\n",
    "index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging\n",
    "regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is\n",
    "decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible\n",
    "trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in\n",
    "the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total\n",
    "amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given\n",
    "predictor, averaged over all $B$ trees."
