    "low-dimensional affine subspace $S$ of dimension $d$ much smaller than\n",
    "the total dimension $D$ of the problem at hand (our data\n",
    "set). Mathematically it can be formulated as a statistical problem or\n",
    "a geometric problem.  In our discussion of the theorem for the\n",
    "classical PCA, we will stay with a statistical approach. \n",
    "Historically, the PCA was first formulated in a statistical setting in order to estimate the principal component of a multivariate random variable.\n",

The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier discussed in the SVM lectures."
